# 🏗️ Creational Design Patterns Course

</div>

### Learn the main creational design patterns with JavaScript and TypeScript.

> 🧩 This repository contains practical examples of the five main creational design patterns.

## 🚀 Description

This project is a comprehensive guide to **Creational Design Patterns** implemented in both **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**. It provides clear, practical examples of how to implement and use these fundamental software design patterns.

The repository includes implementations of:

- **Singleton** - Ensures a class has only one instance
- **Factory** - Creates objects without specifying exact classes
- **Abstract Factory** - Creates families of related objects
- **Builder** - Constructs complex objects step by step
- **Prototype** - Creates new objects by cloning existing ones

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Git
2. Bun

   ```

2. **Run any pattern example:**

   Each pattern has both JavaScript and TypeScript implementations. You can run them with Bun:

   ```bash
   # TypeScript example
   bun builder/builder.ts

   # JavaScript example
   bun builder/builder.js
   ```

## 🎯 Technologies

- **JavaScript** - Dynamic implementation examples
